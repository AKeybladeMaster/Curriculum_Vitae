# Curriculum_Vitae

Here we are, yet another tiny Java app from me 🍭

This program let's you make a sort of resume out of your work and study experiences!

Its main functions are:
- adding an experience (with random generated ID)
- deleting an experience by ID
- print the resume sorted by work experiences first then studies

There's not much else to say; enjoy! 🤙
